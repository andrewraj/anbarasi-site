**Sound editor, audio assistant**

Daulat is Malaysia's first political film and I feel so privileged to work with the big team like **Imran Sheikh, the director of the film**. I perapared ADR scripts and scheduled talents to record their voices for particular scenes which I find a little distorted or lack of clarity. Another big opportunity, I had a pleasure to record **Vanida Imran**, she is a very good dubbing artist too, as I recorded her voice I also suggested how she should tone her voice based on the scenes and she was just ready to accept my suggestions. I also recorded **Rashidi Ishak and Sangeetha Krishnasamy** and etc. last but not least, I had a recording session with **Jasmine Suraya Chin**, there were certain lines she had speaks in Mandarin language in the film and she insisted help in pronunciation so since i know a Mandarin language i helped her with the pronunciation and the recording session ended pretty well.
