**Sound editor, audio engineer, sound designer**

Wangi was a horror genre, so I started my audio recording journey here, my senior engineer Mr.Terry has a major part in every single project i do ever since i step into Klpost production house.I have learned audio recording process and ADR setup in Pro tools from Mr. Terry as well ,i have recorded one of Malaysia’s prominent stars Era Fazira and Sharnas Ahmad’s voices.Meanwhile,Mr.Terry was working on Geran which was an action genre, we both were scheduled to work at the same time for each film,so i also assisted to record adr for Geran and that gave me a lots of experiences and dealing with big stars like Namron and Faizal Hussein, Azlan Komeng and etc.
